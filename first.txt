This is my first file in main branch. This error occurs when you have a nested Git repository (also called a submodule) that hasn't been properly initialized. The folder farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/ appears to be a Git repository inside your main repository.
Quick Solutions:
Option 1: Remove the nested .git folder (Simplest)
bash# Navigate to the problematic directory
cd "farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/"

# Remove the .git folder (this removes Git tracking from this subfolder)
rm -rf .git

# Go back to your main directory
cd ../..

# Now try adding files again
git add .
Option 2: Check what's in that directory
bash# List all files including hidden ones
ls -la "farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/"

# Or on Windows
dir /a "farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/"
Option 3: If it's supposed to be a submodule
bash# Add it as a proper submodule (if it has its own remote repository)
git submodule add <repository-url> farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/
Option 4: Move files out and restructure
bash# Create a temporary folder
mkdir temp-backend

# Move all files (except .git) from the nested folder
cp -r "farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/"* temp-backend/

# Remove the problematic nested structure
rm -rf "farmfresh-backend/farmfresh-backend/"

# Move files to where you want them
mv temp-backend/* farmfresh-backend/

# Clean up
rmdir temp-backend

# Now try again
git add .
What Likely Happened:

Extracted a zip file that contained a Git repository
Cloned a repository inside another repository
Copied files from another Git project

To Prevent This:
When extracting projects:
bash# After extracting, check for nested .git folders
find . -name ".git" -type d
When copying code:

Never copy .git folders unless you specifically need them
Copy only the source files, not the entire repository

Recommended Solution:
I recommend Option 1 (removing the nested .git folder) unless you specifically need that subdirectory to be its own Git repository. Here's the step-by-step:
bash# 1. Navigate to your main project folder
cd "C:\Users\DELL\Music\fyp farmfresh\New folder (3) - Copy"

# 2. Remove the nested .git folder
rmdir /s "farmfresh-backend\farmfresh-backend\.git"

# 3. Try adding files again
git add .

# 4. Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add farmfresh backend files"
Try Option 1 first - it's the most straightforward solution. Let me know what you find in that directory and I can provide more specific guidance!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
